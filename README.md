**Project Name:** Loan Data Analytics

**Important Note:** Loan Data.csv is the original csv for the project, I created the other files so they can expand upon the locations of the "banks".

**Skills acquired:**

Data Modeling - Relationships
Power Query Editor
Instantiating index queries
Data Cleaning
Data Visualization
Data Transforming

**Project Description:** In this project, I analyzed a collection of loans using Power BI, utilizing the Power Query Editor to transform and clean the data for in-depth analysis. The project involved multiple techniques: extracting data from csv, changing data types, removing columns, instantiating queries into folders, data modeling with relationships to indexes and filtering rows.

This project helped develop my skills not only in data transformation such as data modeling with multiple table relationships, but in data visualization as well. The visuals included in this project were: stacked bar charts, maps, area line charts, donut charts, scorecards and tables.
